                DOTP is a key component in floor and roof coatings, wallpaper, cable compounds and other construction products used to ensure
                higher strength, wear and cold resistance. In addition, as a phthalate-free plasticiser, DOTP meets the highest
                environmental requirements. DOTP production will use text feedstock and become yet another process stage
                along the value chain. The Russian market of common plasticisers faces a shortage of about 60 ktpa, which
                is covered with supplies from Europe. The Perm-based DOTP project will help substitute a major part of alternative
                product imports and enable plasticiser supplies to export markets, where the demand for DOTP is also rapidly
                growing. As part of the project, the Company signed a licence agreement with Aekyung Petrochemical, South
                Korea.

                The core process equipment was scheduled to be assembled in July and August, with two out of four reactors having been successfully
                installed in their designed position. The reactors are supplied by the Yekaterinburg-based Uralkhimmash.
                In addition, a washing column and DOTP and 2-ethylhexanol treatment columns have been fully assembled.


            </p>
            <p>
                Construction and installation works are carried out by two Perm-based contractors – GSE-Permneftegazstroy (general contractor
                for construction) and RSP Alexiy. So far, approximately 65% of the total works have been completed.

                The Perm site team aims to wrap up the construction and assembly exercise and switch to pre-commissioning operations in December
                2018. The new facility is planned for launch in 1H 2019.
